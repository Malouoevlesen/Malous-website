<h2 class="headline">About Malou..</h2>
<p class="welcome-b">
  If you have already checked out my website, you probably know by now that I am trying to make it as a web developer. Since this is the "about me" page, I should probably tell you some stuff about me. You know, just in case.
  <br  />
  <br  />
  Hi. I am Malou, a pretty normal person fighting for what I wanna do in life. I try to get the best out of my life, and never take myself too seriously.
  <br  />
  <br  />
  Gaming, cooking, traveling and spending time with my family is pretty much my favourite things to do.
  <br  />
  <br  />
  As a kid I got quite heavy into gaming, and it has been one of my passions since then. I have always found the IT industry facinating, and hoped that someday I could be a part of it.
  <br  />
  <br  />
  However this is not where my journey starts.
  <br  />
  <br  />
  In 2017 I gratuated from optometry school. In the 3,5 years it took to educate myself, I was working along in a optician shop.
  <br />
  I liked my job, but I always had a feeling that something wasn't quite right.
  <br  />
  <br  />
  I then decided it was time to fulfill my dreams. I quit my job, and started working from home.
  <br  />
  I took in all opportunities I could. Worked on Codeacademy, Udemy, went to different courses and got all the help I could get from my fiancé who is in the IT industry.
  <br  />
  <br  />

  So here I am. Some people don't get to accomplish their dreams for various reasons, but here I am. Trying to fulfill mine.
